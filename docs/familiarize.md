## Overview

Before upscaling, you will want to make sure that you familiarize yourself with the base dataset so you know if using this database is appropriate for the upscale that you are interested in. If you have your own database of GUT and some response, you are welcome to adapt the scripts and process to call on your own database. You may also want to try augmenting your own database with some from this repository to increase sample sizes.

## What's next?
Once you are sure that you want to use the database, you can make [selections]({{ site.baseurl }}/select) of streams that are similar to streams in your basin. This is handy if you do not already have GUT and modelling runs for the different river styles and conditions in your network. If you already have GUT runs for your own streams you  can skip the selections step and instead go directly to [reviewing]({{ site.baseurl }}/select) your data.

Go to the [next step](({{ site.baseurl }}/select))
